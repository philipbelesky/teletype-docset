A docset file for [Monome's Teletype](https://monome.org/docs/teletype/) module. Draws directly from the official [Monome docs](https://github.com/monome/docs) but repackages them for use with applications such as [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash).

## Credits

The Monome docs are licensed with [Creative Commons 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and this repository (minimally) adapts those works. Changes are not made to the Teletype source file from the official repository, but the presentation of that work as a 'docset' is distinct to better suit the intended use.

Thanks for technosophos, for this [dashing](hhttps://github.com/technosophos/dashing#readme) which has made this whole process easy!
